#~ "For most artists I know “Art "

#~ " our work as a “living” entity "
#~ "not as a fossil, we are often "
#~ "unsure if a project is finished, "
#~ "we snub techniques that may help "
#~ "us document, organize or account for "
#~ "our work as something that stifles "
#~ "our experimentation and creative process. "
#~ "In addition, especially when we are "
#~ "resentful that institutions are not "
#~ "collecting and preserving our work in"
#~ " the first place, we reject the "
#~ "whole concept of an Art collection, "
#~ "—agreeing with critical historians for "

#~ " Art represents an obsessive-compulsive "
#~ "vampiric culture of suspended animation "
#~ "and speculation that is grounded in "

#~ "or zombiefication. Perhaps despite being "
#~ "a staunch democratic socialist you now"
#~ " have your own Art collection. Or "
#~ "maybe you have met a few "

#~ "“Subtitled Public” made in 2005. In "
#~ "this work you enter an empty room,"
#~ " are tracked by computerized surveillance,"
#~ " and a random verb is projected "
#~ "on your body which follows you "
#~ "everywhere, —the only way to get "
#~ "rid of the word is to touch "
#~ "somebody and exchange words with him "
#~ "or her. The project was written in"
#~ " Delphi, using firewire cameras, IR "
#~ "illuminators and XGA projectors. Using "
#~ "an impressive and comprehensive method "
#~ "Pip ensured that the piece that is"
#~ " at Tate can be performed using "
#~ "these original technologies, giving the "
#~ "public a snapshot of what computerized"
#~ " tracking was like in 2005. So "

#~ "firewire is dead, projectors now have"

#~ " is not about the specific tracking"
#~ " and projection used but about the"

#~ "software for an initial amount, then "
#~ "the artist improves this over time "
#~ "(in a way the artist provides a"

#~ "version or both. It depends on the"

#Specification of competences and skills for digital preservation

[Juergen Enge] (https://www.hawk-hhg.de/hochschule/191898_192525.php)Â· OCTOBER 01, 2015

According to the AIC *[Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies] (http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf)* (2003) "the conservator must possess intrinsic sensitivity to the materials of which cultural heritage is made. The conservator should aspire to develop and enhance these sensitivities throughout his or her career" (AIC 2003, 5). Regarding computer and/or network based artworks intrinsic sensitivity requires a deep knowledge of computer scientific facts, conditions, impacts and long term risk assessments. 

Identification of technological components and applied tools is a required but not sufficient step in the preservation planning process. The conservator must be able to identify technological components (i.e. hardware, ...), the logical (i.e. network, ...) and semantic (i.e. meaning, relevance, disposability) layer. The appraisal of future technological and semantic change is a key element in the risk analysis within the preservation planning.

AIC defines the areas of competencies as follows:
1. Conservation Terminology
2. Conservation History, Ethics, and Philosophy
3. Values and Significance
4. History of Technology of Cultural Heritage
5. Access and Use of Cultural Heritage
6. Health and Safety Policies and Regulations
7. Scientific Principles and Methods
8. Processes of Deterioration and Change
9. Preventive Care
10. Examination Methods
11. Documentation
12. Treatment Methods (ib).

Applied to the field of digital preservation these areas require closer considerations and additional specifications.

##Conservation Terminology
Whereas "general terms that are used widely within every conservation specialty" derives from the conservation community the terms from the field of spezialization is - in most of the cases - originated in the field of computer sciences.

CAVEAT: Modifying the meaning common terminology (e.g. from computer sciences) obscures facts.

##Access and Use of Cultural Heritage
Concerning digital artworks, the OAIS model differs between the acquired original object (SIP), the archival information package (AIP), which is the produced for archival (long term) purposes, and the dissemination information package (DIP) which is displayed e.g. in the exhibition context. Within the context of digital preservation, this should include the remarks from the preservation history which make semantic and technological change understandable (e.g. Mac System Software 4.0 emulated on Linux System).
Furthermore, in the information age "Access and Use" should include access to the (written) documentation, the open discussion of applied conservation actions, and feedback options to enable the scientific reuse of results.
